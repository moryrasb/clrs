/*
âœ… Loop Invariant

Loop invariant:
At the start of each iteration of the for loop (before processing bit i),
carry and C[0..iâˆ’1] together represent the correct binary sum of the lower i bits of A and B.

Formally:
Î£ (from k = 0 to iâˆ’1) [ C[k] * 2^k ] + carry * 2^i = Î£ (from k = 0 to iâˆ’1) [ (A[k] + B[k]) * 2^k ]

ðŸ§© Proof of Correctness

1. Initialization

Before the first iteration (i = 0):
No bits have been processed yet.
C[0..âˆ’1] is empty.
carry = 0.

So the invariant holds, because 0 = 0.

âœ… Initialization is correct.

2. Maintenance

Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration i.
We process the next bits A[i] and B[i] and the current carry.

We compute:
sum = A[i] + B[i] + carry
C[i] = sum mod 2
carry = floor(sum / 2)

This is equivalent to performing correct binary addition for bit i, updating C[i] and the next carry properly.
Thus after processing bit i, the invariant still holds for the next iteration (i + 1).

âœ… The invariant is maintained.

3. Termination

The loop terminates after i = n âˆ’ 1.

At that point, the invariant implies:
Î£ (from k = 0 to nâˆ’1) [ C[k] * 2^k ] + carry * 2^n = Î£ (from k = 0 to nâˆ’1) [ (A[k] + B[k]) * 2^k ]

Finally, we set C[n] = carry, so:
Î£ (from k = 0 to n) [ C[k] * 2^k ] = Î£ (from k = 0 to nâˆ’1) [ (A[k] + B[k]) * 2^k ]

which exactly equals a + b.

âœ… Termination gives correct output.

 Note: this algorithm does not use conversion so no worries about big numbers

    let carry  = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const sum = num1[i]+num2[i]+carry;
        result[i] = sum %2 ;
        carry = Math.floor(sum/2);

    result[n] = carry;

/*
loop 1:
Initialization:
Before the first iteration (i = 0), s1 = 0, s2 = 0.
âœ… The sum of 0 bits is 0, so invariant holds.

Maintenance:
On iteration i, we add num1[i]*2^i and num2[i]*2^i.
After the addition, s1 and s2 correctly represent the sum of the first i+1 bits.
âœ… Invariant maintained.

Termination:
After i = n, s1 and s2 equal the decimal values of the full arrays.
âœ… Invariant ensures correct conversion.


loop 2 :
Initialization:
Before the first iteration (j = 0), result[0..âˆ’1] is empty, sum = s1 + s2.
âœ… Invariant holds.

Maintenance:
At iteration j, we set result[j] = sum % 2 (current LSB) and remove it from sum using Math.floor(sum / 2).
âœ… The invariant still holds: sum + Î£ result[k]*2^k = s1 + s2.

Termination:
Loop ends when sum = 0.
At this point, result[0..jâˆ’1] contains all bits of s1 + s2.
âœ… Result array correctly represents the sum in binary.

o(n)
Note: this algorithm as conversion part so should be careful about big numbers
